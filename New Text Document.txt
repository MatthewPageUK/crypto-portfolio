Matt's Crypto Portfolio Manager [MCMP]


The problem I want to solve.

Buying, selling and tracking many different crypto assets across multiple exchanges is difficult and time consuming. 



The solution I propose.

A PHP web based interface and reporting tool with the following key features

 - Interface with Coinbase and Binance APIs
 - Report on assets held, profit and loss, performance over time
 - Creation of new orders in bulk, market and limit
 - Creation of new sell orders in bulk, market and limt
 - Monitoring of open orders
 - Order chains - buy low, sell high


Platform.

PHP 8 with no dependancies. Wheel invention time :)
MySQL (?)


Modelling.

I will model this project as simply as possible using real world objects and only abstract into concepts(?) where needed.


CryptoAsset - Bitcoin, Doge etc
Transaction - A purchase or sale
Balance - Current held balance of a CryptoAsset
Exchange - An exchange with an API
Order - An order on an exchange, open or filled
OrderChain - 


Tasks I want to achive.

 - Overview of my holdings, dashboard
 - Individual asset dashboard and overview
 - Place a buy order
 - Place a sell order
 - Place a multi order (buy Â£50 each of DOGE, ANKR, ETH)
 - ....
